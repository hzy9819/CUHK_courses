# SEEM 5580 Homework 2

##### 2.11 

<font face = "Times New Roman">**Problem**: Cars pass a certain street location according to a Poission process with rate $\lambda$. A person wanting to cross the street at that location waits until she can see that no cars will come by in the next $T$ time units. Find the expected time that the person waits before starting to cross (Note, for instance, that if no cars will be passing in the first $T$ time units then the waiting time is 0)</font>

<font face = "Times New Roman">**Problem:** Let $T_1, T_2, ...$ denote the interarrival times of events of a nonhomogeneous Poisson process having intensity function $\lambda(t)$</font>

​	<font face = "Times New Roman">**(a)** Are the $T_i$ independent?</font>

​	<font face = "Times New Roman">**(b)** Are the $T_i$ identically distributed?</font>

​	<font face = "Times New Roman">**(c)** Find the distribution of $T_1$</font>

​	<font face = "Times New Roman">**(d)** Find the distribution of $T_2$</font>
